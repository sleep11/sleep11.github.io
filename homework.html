    <p>I'm writing this article while I could be doing my math homework. It doesn't really matter if I write this now or later as my math homework will not take long to complete.
    Typing a blog post in the mac terminal is really not a great way to do this. It would be nice if I wasn't surrounded by syntax as I was typing this and I could actually see what it looks like on the page.
I'll have to come up with a different way to write these, probably write it in a different file and transfer it somehow. Doesn't really matter, i'm just doing random stuff right now.
